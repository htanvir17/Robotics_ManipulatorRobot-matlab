# Manipulator Robot: Robotic surgery
This repository contains information of a robotics project that has a goal of helping surgeons to plan a simulation of brain surgery. The operation has three parts: doing a biopsy, making a trepanation and burning the malignant tumor. The ROB (Robotics) course was taken in 2021-Q2, spring season.
